Samurai Jack was a warrior who was trapped in the future, thanks to a curse put on him by an evil wizard, Aku. Samurai Jack spent every episode battling Aku and his robot army in an attempt to find a time portal that would take him back to his own time. There was very little dialogue, but the comic book-like action moved the story effectively. </p>

Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are the superhero little girls made of sugar, spice, and everything nice, with a dash of Chemical X thrown in. The Powerpuff Girls was created by Craig McCracken for Cartoon Network, based on a 1992 cartoon short he produced called The Whopass Girls!. The short premiered in "Sticky Situation," a mock episode of The Powerpuff Girls played at Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in 1994 (that's also how Mike Judge got started). The Powerpuff Girls finally premiered during Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons in 1995. It went on to earn five Emmy nominations and win two awards. </p>
